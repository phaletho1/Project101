Configuration Steps: Please note I had to separate the two part because of the conflicting dependencies on my pom file but due to time - I just decided to split the two parts.

Install the Intellij IDEA Community version or selenium 
Clone the project from github - each project for each(Part 1 and Part 2)
Update the maven dependicies once the project is cloned to your local machine
LAST step do a build and run the tests 
Please note the chrome driver on this project support only the latest version (Version 99.0.4844.84 (Official Build) (64-bit)) and 

Also the URL for the API is throwing a 403 Forbidden Error - I was anot able to test but I believe the code I've written should return the response.
